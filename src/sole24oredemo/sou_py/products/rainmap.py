def read_tiff(path_name, geo=False):
    """
    Reads the first band of a TIFF file as a NumPy array and optionally retrieves geographical bounds.

    Args:
        path_name (str): The file path to the TIFF image.
        geo (bool, optional): If True, returns the geographical bounds of the image. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - np.ndarray: Array of pixel values for the first band of the TIFF image.
            - tuple or None: Geographical bounds of the image (left, bottom, right, top), if `geo` is True; otherwise, returns None.

    Notes:
        - Uses `rasterio` to open and read the TIFF file.
        - If `geo` is set to True, the function fetches the image's geographical boundaries.
        - Handles cases where the TIFF file might be empty or unreadable by returning `None`.

        maxwait (int): Maximum time to wait (in seconds) for the file to become available.

    Returns:
        bool: Currently returns True as a placeholder. Once implemented, it should return:
            - True if the file is found within the specified wait time.
            - False if the file is not found within `maxwait` seconds.

    Notes:
        - This function is a placeholder and not yet implemented. Currently, it only logs a warning and immediately returns True.

def rainmap(prodId, delay=None):
    """
    Processes and stores rainfall data for a specific product ID by locating and reading a TIFF file containing
    rainfall intensity values.

    Args:
        prodId (int): The ID of the product node, containing configurable parameters for the rainfall data retrieval.
        delay (int, optional): Number of minutes to subtract from the current time to find a specific data file.
                               If None, no delay is applied.

    Returns:
        int: Status code representing the outcome of the process:
            - 0 indicates successful file retrieval and processing.
            - 1 indicates an error, such as missing file or failed read operation.

    Workflow:
        1. Retrieves configuration parameters for file paths, prefixes, and deletion rules.
        2. Gets the current or adjusted date and time, creating a filename based on these values.
        3. Checks if the file exists within the specified waiting period (`maxWait`), then reads it as a TIFF file.
        4. If the TIFF file is successfully read:
            - Filters out invalid values, setting them to NaN.
            - Stores the processed data in the array associated with `prodId`.
            - Records the geographic boundaries of the TIFF file for navigation purposes.
        5. Optionally deletes the TIFF file based on configuration.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified TIFF file is not found within the `maxWait` duration.
        ValueError: If the TIFF file cannot be read or if data is improperly formatted.

    Notes:
        - The `waitRainFile` function handles file availability checks but is currently unimplemented.
        - The TIFF file is deleted post-processing only if `deleteFile` is set to a value greater than 0.
